3-Band Compressor Audio Plugin with JUCE Framework

My take on the Audio Plugin made via C++ watching the Tutorial by freeCodecamp on youtube taught by Matkatmusic

A compressor is used to reduce the dynamic range of audio by moving the highs and lows of a signal closer together. It does this by lowering the volume of the highest parts of a source while at the same time raising the overall volume.


The Source Folder has 2 parts
 - DSP - Digital Signal Processor - C++ files which make the compressor plugin work this is written in Modern c++
 - GUI - C++ files for the graphical user interface of the plugin.
